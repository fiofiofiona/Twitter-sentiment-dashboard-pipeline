## Introduction:
We propose a workflow for analyzing the sentiments surrounding trending topics on Twitter. We will first stream the Twitter API to the AWS services, and provide analytical data upon keyword queries. By conducting content analysis tasks such as sentiment classification on those tweet conversations and organizing the descriptive information on a dashboard, our pipeline could allow users to gain the insights of how a specified topic is led and discussed by opinion leaders. 

Given the vast growth in social media usage and reliance for news and information, developing a large-scale method to collect and analyze Twitter data as described above would help inform how users feel and perceive the information that can then potentially inform downstream decision-making behaviors.
